# Major League Baseball's Home Game Attendance: The Pulse of the American Pastime
I want to emphasize the word "pulse" because home game attendance is a vital sign of baseball. Home game attendance rises and falls with happenings around the league, the country, and the world. In this project, I focus on the history of baseball, and what it implies about the future of the sport.
